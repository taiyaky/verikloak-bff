## [0.1.1] - 2025-09-15

### Changed
- Centralize `MAX_TOKEN_BYTES` in `Verikloak::BFF::Constants` and refactor usages in `HeaderGuard` and `ConsistencyChecks` to avoid duplication.

### Fixed
- Preserve full token content when forwarded header includes control characters (e.g., `Bearer tok\r\nmal`) by adjusting Bearer parsing in `ForwardedToken.normalize_forwarded`; combined with existing sanitization, Authorization now normalizes to `Bearer tokmal`.

### Tests
- Add boundary tests for token size limits in `ConsistencyChecks` and `HeaderGuard`.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-14

- Claims/header consistency checks、`X-Auth-Request-*` stripping
- Env passthrough: `verikloak.bff.token`, `verikloak.bff.selected_peer`
